LandChecker Registration Page Initial Automation

My second attempt in the initial automation of LandChecker's registration page.

In this test automation repo, I have initially created 18 test cases namely:

- Registration - Check if the Page Title is consistent or not
- Registration - Check existence of the registration page header
- Registration - First Name Requirement Error works as intended
- Registration - Last Name Requirement Error works as intended
- Registration - Email Address Requirement Error works as intended
- Registration - Password Requirement Error works as intended
- Registration - Occupation Requirement Error works as intended
- Registration - Terms of Use Requirement Error works as intended
- Registration - First Name input field allows entry of string value
- Registration - Last Name input field allows entry of string value
- Registration - Email input field allows entry of string value
- Registration - Password input field allows entry of string value
- Registration - Company Name input field allows entry of string value
- Registration - Check dropdown availability and choose Real Estate Agent in the given options
- Registration - Verify State Checkboxes if clickable or not
- Registration - Verify Terms of Use checkbox if clickable or not
- Registration - Verify Terms Of Use Redirect
- Registration - Verify Existence of Footer
- Registration - Verify Login Redirection

Note that this could've been implemented faster upon running, I added slow typing on certain input fields apart from the automatic one.

And can be ran locally. The automated testing framework used is Cypress.
